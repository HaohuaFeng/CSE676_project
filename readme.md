# Group 6 : Emotion Recognition from Facial Expressions
## Author: Haohua Feng, PinKuan Hsieh
# Abstract:
The project's objective is to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model capable of accurately distinguishing human facial expressions. Our target is to achieve a minimum accuracy rate of 95%. The ultimate aim is to implement this model in user interface design and mental health monitoring applications.

# 1. Dataset:
We utilize the FER-2013 dataset, comprising a training subset and a testing subset. Our approach involves training a CNN on the training set and evaluating its performance using the testing set.
